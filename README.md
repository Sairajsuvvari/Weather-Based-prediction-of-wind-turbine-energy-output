## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **predicting the energy output of wind turbines based on weather conditions** using **Machine Learning and Flask**. Accurate energy prediction is crucial for renewable energy management, helping energy companies, wind farm operators, and grid operators make informed decisions.

By analyzing **historical wind and weather data**, a regression-based machine learning model is trained to predict turbine energy output under given weather conditions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Type

✔ **Regression Problem**
Because the output (energy in kWh) is a **continuous numerical value**, regression algorithms are used.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

### The Challenge

Wind farms face significant operational challenges in predicting energy output and optimizing turbine performance. Traditional forecasting methods rely on historical averages and manual analysis, which lack precision and adaptability to dynamic weather conditions.

### 🔑 Key Highlights

#### 1. 🌍 **Importance of Renewable Energy**
- Renewable energy accounts for **25-30%** of global electricity generation
- Wind energy is the fastest-growing renewable source
- Accurate prediction reduces grid instability by **15-20%**
- Critical for achieving carbon neutrality goals (UN SDG 13)

#### 2. 🌪️ **Wind Energy's Dependency on Weather**
- Wind power output is **directly proportional** to wind speed (cubic relationship)
- Atmospheric pressure and temperature affect air density
- Humidity influences turbine efficiency by **5-8%**
- Weather-driven variability requires real-time prediction models

#### 3. 📊 **Need for Intelligent Prediction**
- Energy companies need **24-48 hour forecasts** for grid planning
- Maintenance scheduling requires **production predictions**
- Reduces energy wastage by **10-15%** through accurate planning
- Enables dynamic pricing based on predicted supply
